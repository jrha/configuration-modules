	SSH.

2010-06-02  Luis Fernando Muñoz Mejías <Luis.Fernando.Munoz.Mejias@cern.ch>

	* Release: 1.5.6
	- Fix the removal of outdated entries on PAM files.

2009-11-24 Luis Fernando Muñoz Mejías <Luis.Fernando.Munoz.Mejias@cern.ch>

	* Release: 1.5.5
	- Add ACLs to PAM 'session' lines as well.

	contents the ACL had.

	* Release: 1.5.4
	- Enable ACLs right on the top of the PAM files.

	* Release: 1.5.3

2009-05-18  Luis Fernando Muñoz Mejías

	* Release: 1.5.2
	- Document the managed_credentials field.

2009-05-15  Luis Fernando Muñoz Mejías

	* Release: 1.5.1

2009-05-13  Luis Fernando Muñoz Mejías

	* Release: 1.5.0
	- Add a hack to control which files should be managed by the
	component.

	CERN was using different tools for handling the
	.ssh/authorized_keys file, and was colliding with this
	component. The proper way to solve it would be by disabling
	this component on the affected users, but they needed it to
	control PAM ACLs. And PAM ACLs should be moved to a different
	component but that needs some time I don't have, so this is
	the quick hack.

2009-02-10  Luis Fernando Muñoz Mejías,Luis.Fernando.Munoz.Mejias@cern.ch

	* Release: 1.4.6
	- Replacing "remove" with "unlink" to keep it more
	standard-perl-ish.

2009-02-10  Luis Fernando Muñoz Mejías,<Luis.Fernando.Munoz.Mejias@cern.ch>

	* Release: 1.4.5
	- Fixing some crashes when the user's home dir is not
	writeable.

	To do it, I removed the use of LC::File::{remove,makedir}, as I
	don't have time to learn how to deal with exceptions on perl-LC.

	- Reverting 1.3.3, as it didn't work as expected.

2008-06-10  Luis Fernando Muñoz Mejías

	* Release: 1.3.3
	- Don't cause any errors if the files of a user can't be opened but there are no settings for him.
	For instance, if home directories are mounted with AFS, root won't be able to reach them, but if
	the user doesn't have any Kerberos or SSH settings no errors should be thrown.
