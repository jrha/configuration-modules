	* Release: 1.2.1
	- When using the 'default' setting, not all runlevels were set
	
	The default setting allows all runlevels of non-specified services
	to be set to the same value, however an inappropriate 'last' meant
	that only the first runlevel of the service was reset, not all the
	runlevels.

	* Release: 1.2.0
	- unescape the service names
	
	Some service names (at least on RHEL5) have underscores in the name
	which is illegal as a hash key. So we need to escape them, which means
	we also need to unescape them in the component
