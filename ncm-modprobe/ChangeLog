	* Release: 1.2.1
	- bug #70562: install/remove doesn't work

2009-07-24  Luis Fernando Muñoz Mejías

	* Release: 1.2.0
	- Make it able to modify existing lines, not only to add new ones.

	It was only able to add lines to /etc/modprobe.conf, which meant
	that if you needed to change something (f.i, different options to
	a module) you needed to log into the machine, remove the options
	line and re-run the component. Otherwise, two "option" lines would
	be added. It's better now. However, it doesn't REMOVE lines. F.i,
	if you want to remove an alias you still have to do it manually.
