# Quattor Client Configuration Modules

## Description

Node Configuration Manager's components are Perl modules that
translate a Pan schema into a configuration for some Linux service.

They are part of [Quattor](www.quattor.org).

## Catalog ##

An incomplete list of what you can expect with our current library of
NCM components:

* Addition/removal/modification of local accounts
* Configuration of [sudo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudo).
* Configuration of [Nagios](http://www.nagios.org) and NRPE.
* Configuration of [Icinga](http://www.icinga.org).

... and much more.

## TODO ##

We need a link with the full documentation!
