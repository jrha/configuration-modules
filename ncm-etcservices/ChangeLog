	-   I have found and corrected another bug. The /etc/services file 
	  must be a link to /etc/inet/services but the component overwrote 
	  that link each time that it performed an update from the CDB. 
	  This was because of the 'rename' perl command. When you rename a
	  file in Perl (also in linux) with the name of an existing file, 
	  it is overwritten without any warning of error. The component
	  wrote the changes to a temporal file and renamed it later as 
	  /etc/services so the link from /etc/services to /etc/inet/services
	  was deleted.

	-   Now the component will write directly to /etc/inet/services and 
	  the link will be not deleted.

	-   Bug #5012 corrected. Now, if the component finds a /etc/services
	  line with the same content as the one stored at the CDB but with a 
	  different port, that port will be corrected. Before the component 
	  just added the correct line AFTER the wrong one. 
	-   I also added many comments to the code.
	-   Currently I am the maintainer of the component so I changed also
	  the MAINTAINER file.
