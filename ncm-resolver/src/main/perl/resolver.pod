=head1 NAME

NCM::resolver - NCM resolver configuration component

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=over

=item Configure()

Sets up the resolv.conf (and optionally the dnscache configuration).
If dnscache is used, then dnscache will be restarted on any change.
If DNS resolution fails after making the change, then resolv.conf
is left in it's previous state.

=head1 RESOURCES

=over

=item * C<< /software/components/resolver/active >> : boolean

activates/deactivates the component.

=item * C<< /software/componens/resolver/search >> : list

A list of strings to use for the resolver search path.

=item * C<< /software/components/resolver/servers >> : list

list of server addresses or hostnames. If these are
hostnames, they will be resolved before the resolver 
configuration is modified.

=item * C<< /software/components/resolver/dnscache >> : boolean

If true, then configure dnscache with the server list
and point resolv.conf at the localhost. This will
cause dnscache to be restarted. This implies that
the dnscache package is available on the machine, 
but this component does not enforce that.
