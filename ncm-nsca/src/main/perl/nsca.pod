=head1 DESCRIPTION

The I<nsca> component manages the NSCA daemon and the NSCA client configuration.
The NSCA client (sender) is used to submit check results that are obtained on a node to the Nagios server.
In Nagios terms, they are known as passive check results (i.e. not initated by Nagios).

=head1 COMPONENT STRUCTURE

This component can be used to configure an NSCA daemon and/or NSCA client. 
The daemon is only configured if its configuration exists under C<< /software/components/nsca/daemon >>,
the client part is configured if the configuration under C<< /software/components/nsca/send >> is defined.

=head2 NSCA DAEMON

All fields are mandatory, unless it is explicitly stated:

=over 4

=item * C<< / software/components/nsca/daemon/pid_file >> : string

The name of the file in which the NSCA daemon should write its process ID
number.
Defaults to C<< /var/run/nsca.pid >>.

=item * C<< / software/components/nsca/daemon/server_port >> : long

Port number on which the daemon should listen for connections.

=item * C<< / software/components/nsca/daemon/server_address >> : string

Address that NSCA has to bind to in case there is more as one interface.
This field is optional.

=item * C<< / software/components/nsca/daemon/user >> : string

This determines the effective user that the NSCA daemon should run as.
Defaults to "nagios".

=item * C<< / software/components/nsca/daemon/group >> : string

This determines the effective group that the NSCA daemon should run as.
Defaults to "nagios".

=item * C<< / software/components/nsca/daemon/chroot >> : string

This determines a directory into which the nsca daemon
will perform a chroot(2) operation before dropping its privileges.
This field is optional.

=item * C<< / software/components/nsca/daemon/debug >> : boolean

This option determines whether or not debugging
messages are logged to the syslog facility.
Defaults to false.

=item * C<< / software/components/nsca/daemon/command_file >> : string

This is the location of the Nagios command file that the daemon
should write all service check results that it receives.
Defaults to C<< /var/log/nagios/rw/nagios.cmd >>.

=item * C<< / software/components/nsca/daemoni/alt_dump_file >> : string

This is used to specify an alternate file the daemon should
write service check results to in the event the command file
does not exist.
Defaults to C<< /var/log/nagios/rw/nsca.dump >>.

=item * C<< / software/components/nsca/daemon/aggregate_writes >> : boolean

This option determines whether or not the nsca daemon will
aggregate writes to the external command file for client
connections that contain multiple check results.
Defaults to false.

=item * C<< / software/components/nsca/daemon/append_to_file >> : boolean

This option determines whether or not the nsca daemon will
open the external command file for writing or appending.
Defaults to false.

=item * C<< / software/components/nsca/daemon/max_packet_age >> : long

This option is used by the nsca daemon to determine when client
data is too old to be valid.
Defaults to 30.

=item * C<< / software/components/nsca/daemon/password >> : string

This is the password/passphrase that should be used to decrypt the
incoming packets.

=item * C<< / software/components/nsca/daemon/decryption_method >> : boolean

This option determines the method by which the nsca daemon will
decrypt the packets it receives from the clients.
Defaults to 1.

=back

=head2 NSCA CLIENT

=over 4

=item * C<< / software/components/nsca/send/password >> : string

This is the password/passphrase that should be used to encrypt the
outgoing packets.

=item * C<< / software/components/nsca/send/encryption_method >> : long

This option determines the method by which the send_nsca client will
encrypt the packets it sends to the nsca daemon.
Defaults to 1.
